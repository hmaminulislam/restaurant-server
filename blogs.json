This comes as no surprise to the average taco enthusiast. If you know anything about all the different taco styles out there, you know the options are plentiful when it comes to choosing what types of tacos to order. Originating in Mexico, different types of tacos have been prepared and eaten as a quick, on the go street food since the 18th century. Since first arriving in the United States in 1905, Mexican-style tacos have been tweaked and remixed into countless variations, inspired by flavors from all over the world. These days, a taco can pretty much be defined as anything eaten on a tortilla. But to really test your taco knowledge, let’s get into the classic types of Mexican tacos. Traditional Mexican ingredients and flavors are inseparable when it comes to the classic taco varieties. And while you may be familiar with a few different types of street tacos and the typical American cheese-lettuce-tomato style — here are 15 classic taco varieties that you just have to try in order to consider yourself a true taco connoisseur."

Early Mexico is known for its cows and “cowboys,” so it makes sense that hungry ranchers would stuff grilled steak into a corn tortilla for a filling meal in a pinch. Today’s carne asada tacos still closely resemble classic recipes: Marinated skirt or flank steak is cooked over a flame and thinly sliced. Add a warm corn tortilla, cilantro, onions and a salsa of your choice and you’ve got yourself a solid carne asada taco."

Or, it can be made with green chile peppers and cilantro, which will get you chorizo verde. Both options are delicious, but you’re more likely to see chorizo rojo tacos on the menus at your favorite Mexican restaurants."

This comes as no surprise to the average taco enthusiast. If you know anything about all the different taco styles out there, you know the options are plentiful when it comes to choosing what types of tacos to order. Originating in Mexico, different types of tacos have been prepared and eaten as a quick, on the go street food since the 18th century. Since first arriving in the United States in 1905, Mexican-style tacos have been tweaked and remixed into countless variations, inspired by flavors from all over the world. These days, a taco can pretty much be defined as anything eaten on a tortilla. But to really test your taco knowledge, let’s get into the classic types of Mexican tacos. Traditional Mexican ingredients and flavors are inseparable when it comes to the classic taco varieties. And while you may be familiar with a few different types of street tacos and the typical American cheese-lettuce-tomato style — here are 15 classic taco varieties that you just have to try in order to consider yourself a true taco connoisseur."
